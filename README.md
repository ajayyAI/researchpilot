## What It Does

You type a question. ResearchPilot builds a research plan, executes dozens of targeted web searches in parallel, scores every source for credibility, decides when to go deeper and when to stop, detects contradictions across findings, and assembles a structured report with inline citations.

No manual knobs. The AI determines scope based on your query — you just pick Quick, Thorough, or Deep.

### How It Works

```
Query → Plan → Search → Extract → Assess → Repeat? → Report
```

1. **Plan** — A strategic LLM decomposes your query into 2-5 research aspects with sub-questions and priorities
2. **Search** — Parallel workers execute targeted queries across Firecrawl + Tavily
3. **Extract** — Findings are pulled from each source with claim, evidence, confidence, and source attribution
4. **Assess** — Every source gets a credibility score (domain heuristics + LLM assessment for unknowns)
5. **Adapt** — Information gain is measured after each round. Rich veins get explored deeper. Diminishing returns trigger early stopping
6. **Detect** — LLM-based contradiction detection flags conflicting claims across sources
7. **Gap-fill** — Coverage map identifies missing aspects, triggers up to 2 targeted follow-up rounds
8. **Report** — Outline → section-by-section generation → intro/conclusion → assembly with ranked sources

### Key Design Decisions

- **Immutable state** — Research state is a pure data structure. Every mutation returns a new object. No side effects, easy to serialize, easy to debug.
- **Adaptive depth** — Information gain is measured after each search round. High novelty → keep going. Low novelty → stop. No wasted API calls.
- **Tiered models** — Fast/cheap models handle extraction (~70% of LLM calls). Smart models write the report. Strategic models plan. Cuts cost 40-60%.
- **Abort-aware pipeline** — Client disconnect kills all in-flight LLM calls and searches via `AbortSignal` propagation. No orphaned API spend.
- **Structured outputs** — Every LLM call uses Zod schemas via the Vercel AI SDK's `Output.object`. Type-safe from prompt to response.
- **Collect-then-merge** — Parallel workers return results independently. The orchestrator merges them sequentially after all settle — no race conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.2+
- A [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) API key (search + scraping)
- An AI provider key: [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), or [Groq](https://console.groq.com)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajayyAI/researchpilot.git
cd researchpilot
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configure

Edit `.env` with your API keys:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...        # required — web search + scraping
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter           # openai | openrouter | groq
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...    # key for your chosen provider
```

### Run

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Type a research topic. Pick an effort level. Go.

---

## Configuration

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) API key for web search + scraping |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | `openai`, `openrouter`, or `groq` |
| Provider key | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or `GROQ_API_KEY` |

### Model Tiers (Optional)

Override the default model for each tier to optimize cost vs. quality:

| Variable | Tier | Used For | Example |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| `AI_MODEL` | Default | Fallback for all tiers | `gpt-4.1` |
| `AI_MODEL_FAST` | Fast | Extraction, source scoring, gain assessment | `gpt-4.1-mini` |
| `AI_MODEL_STRATEGIC` | Strategic | Planning, query decomposition | `o4-mini` |

### Search Providers (Optional)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Adds [Tavily](https://tavily.com) as a second search source |
| `TAVILY_SEARCH_DEPTH` | `basic` (default) or `advanced` |
| `FIRECRAWL_CONCURRENCY` | Parallel search limit (default: `2`, increase with paid plan) |

### Effort Levels

Users don't configure breadth or depth directly. They pick an effort level and the AI handles the rest:

| Level | What Happens | Typical Time | Best For |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Quick** | 2 parallel queries, 1 depth level | 30-60s | Fact-checks, simple lookups |
| **Thorough** | 4 parallel queries, 2 depth levels | 2-4 min | Standard research |
| **Deep** | 7 parallel queries, 3 depth levels | 5-10 min | Complex multi-faceted analysis |
